\section{Avionics}

To control and operate the thruster we require an avionics subsystem that can provide power, control signals, and data acquisition. For this several \ac{PCB}s may need to be designed such as the \ac{PPU}, and a seperate low power control board. Accompanying, this electrical system a real time software control system will be needed to operate the thruster, and monitor its performance. 


% Explain high level what is needed in the avionic substem

% Include high level / block diagrams

% Explain that real time software control will be needed
