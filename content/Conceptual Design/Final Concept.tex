\section{Final Concept}

The final basic geometry of our final concept is shown in figure \ref{fig:final_concept}. It is important to note that the render does not include all components such as the propellant feed system and propellant diffuser, and that the design may very well change as we move through the design process. However, it does the job of conveying some of the design goals and choices that have been made. The final concept will consist of the following features:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Center mounted cathode - will allow for a more compact design
    \item Permanent magnet based ferromagnetic core - will reduce power consumption and avionics system complexity
    \item Ring anode - simple and well understood design
    \item Propellant feed system - will consist of a pressure vessel, propellant diffuser, and supporting hardware. May become to primary conductor to the anode.
\end{enumerate}
