\chapter{Conceptual Design}

Over the years, many different designs and configurations of the \ac{HET} have been developed and tested. While there may be many different variations of the thruster, they all share the same basic subsystems, with most concepts focussing on improving one or more of these subsystems. The following section will cover these major subsystems, and existing designs for each of them. This will provide a foundation for the conceptual design of our \ac{HET}, and the reasoning behind the choices made in our design. The major subsystems of a \ac{HET} are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Magnetic Field System
    \item Cathode
    \item Anode and Propellant Feed System
\end{itemize}

This conceptual design phase will focus on the above subsystems, that will affect the thruster architecture. Other aspects such as propellant selection, material selection, and avionics will be discussed in the detailed design, as they are less likely to affect the thruster architecture and rather behave as supporting systems.

Many different types of \ac{HET}s have been developed over the years, with each design having its own advantages and disadvantages. Before diving into the specific subsystems, we will first look at two of the more relevant thruster types:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \ac{AHT}
    \item The \ac{CHT}
\end{itemize}
