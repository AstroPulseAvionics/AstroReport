\section{Hall Thruster Theory}

The construction of a Hall thruster may be relatively simple but the physics involved to produce thrust is much more complicated. The dimensions of the discharge chamber, and the shape and strength of the magnetic field have a great impact on the performance, efficiency, and lifetime of the thruster.
