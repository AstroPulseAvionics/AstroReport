\chapter{Conceptual Design}

Over the years many different designs and configurations of the \ac{HET} have been developed and tested. While there may be many different variations of the thruster, they all share the same basic subsystems, with most concepts focussing on improving one or more of these subsystems. The following section will cover these major subsystems, and existing designs for each of them. This will provide a foundation for the conceptual design of our \ac{HET}, and the reasoning behind the choices made in our design. The major subsystems of a \ac{HET} are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Magnetic Field System
    \item Cathode
    \item Anode and Propellant Feed System
\end{itemize}

Additionally, there are other considerations that must be taken into account such as the general structure and ablation of the thruster walls.
