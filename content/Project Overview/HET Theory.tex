\chapter{Hall Thruster Theory}

Before diving into the design specifics of our \ac{HET}, it is essential to understand the fundamental principles that govern its operation. In comparison to other electric propulsion systems, such as ion thrusters, the construction of a \ac{HET} may be relatively simple, but the physics involved to produce thrust is much more complicated, and less predictable. The dimensions of the discharge chamber, and the shape and strength of the magnetic field have a great impact on the performance, efficiency, and lifetime of the thruster.
